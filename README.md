# review-generator
UCLA Math 156 Group 4 Final Project Winter 2024

## Instructions for Replication
In order to run our project and reproduce our results, follow these steps:
1. Clone our repository by running `git clone https://github.com/ErikMaung/review-generator.git` in your command line or with GitHub Desktop. \
2. Double check that you have the following files: `word_generator.py`, `Project.ipynb`, `reviews.csv`, `README.md`.
2.5. If you would like, you may also obtain the reviews dataset straight from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). However, **be sure to rename the dataset** to `reviews.csv` to ensure the notebook reads the file.
3. Open `Project.ipynb` in your desired client. Ensure `word_generator.py` and `reviews.csv` are in your environment.
4. Run all cells sequentially in the notebook. Additional guidelines and troubleshooting information can be found in comments in each cell.
