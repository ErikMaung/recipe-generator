      "one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me  the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word  it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldnt say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side a wonderful little production   the filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimebbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece   the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life   the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love  this was the most id laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare i say a decade while ive never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman  this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends basically theres a family where a little boy jake thinks theres a zombie in his closet  his parents are fighting all the time  this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie  ok first of all when youre going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing  arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents  descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  the acting is good under mr matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive  we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work probably my alltime favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in mei grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every weekyou have my vote for a comeback of a new sea huntwe need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventureoh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many moviesso any ole way i believe ive got what i wanna saywould be nice to read some more plus points about sea huntif my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submitor leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quitif this is so then i must go so lets do it this show was an amazing fresh  innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and its continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today  its truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad  if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cant believe its still on the air encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them  its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song  a lame country tune  is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film   the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1score is harvey keitel  while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie if you are young or old then you will love this movie hell even my mom liked it  great camp phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines  at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest  i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  for something similar but better try brother from another planet i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror  as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didnt care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor  but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a wellworn formula there are no rules so im not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished   people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller  three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how hes not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we dont really know what he looked like when he was kicking a   however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making geneticallymutatedsoldiers or gms as they are called performing his topsecret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjackwoods we havent even gone far before i started to cry mehehe i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck  there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse thats poop for you simpletons from a far if you wanna take a wiff go ahead btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes hes on screen the cast played shakespeare  shakespeare lost  i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good  is it because the scottish play is my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the victorian era  in other words you cannot improve perfection  i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and im not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film ive ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass its like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible   there wasnt a continuous minute where there wasnt a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix   examples  the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader   the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh hello  and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrixor terminator  there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazis nazis   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either   just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money i remember this filmit was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 7475 my dad took me my brother  sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me knowthe cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe theyve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but its simply bizarre  by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version its hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life  we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity after the success of die hard and its sequels its no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of die hard on a  movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones career  cliffhanger is one big nitpickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing basejumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all its full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get outacted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense its actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs  youve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travers  he may of been henry in portrait of a serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringeworthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cant be it really does look like ralph waites frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death  mention too must go to former londons burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football yes you cant help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking  so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre looking for qaulen hes the one wearing the helicopter i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in its entirety  all i have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst bmovie of all time it shouldnt even be called a bmovie more like an fmovie because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paperthin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake its almost funnyalmost  the movie is just packed full of crappy oneliners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit  this movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably  even some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 25 hrs to kill watch it you wont regret it its too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him i still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it first of all lets get a few things straight here a i am an anime fan always has been as a matter of fact i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool b i do like several bmovies because theyre hilarious c i like the godzilla movies a lot  moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like its going to be your usual bmovie down to the crappy fx but all a sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill  the animation is very bad  cheap even worse than what i remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact its so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie i vividly remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school  its the same kids over  over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue  voicesespecially the english dub that i viewed was horrid  i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes  comments like the robots  joelmike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie  survive it at the same time  heck im planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a bmovie night because its stupid pretty painful to watch  unintentionally hilarious at the same time im giving this movie a 310 an improvement from the 0510 i was originally going to give it  according to my grading scale 310 means pretty much both boring  bad as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15 this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film its great to see jbeals but shes only in the movie for a few minutes mparker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies i saw back in the 90s  and not even a good one in those standards   the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenters complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details  cynthia gibb portrays karen was not a fine election she is a good actress  but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role needed a stronger character someone with a stronger personality  louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific she does a great job as karens mother  it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they werent though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries the cell is an exotic masterpiece a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date  ive read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we dont want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him  weve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied  i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what its all about and not how its all about and i guess thats what some people dont like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in  i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldnt be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me itd at least get nominated for best picture  ive noticed that ive kind of been repeating myself not because theres nothing else to say but because i cant stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smoking   out of 4 this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end  although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film  there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time i at least thought id be able to stand it but i was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents i hated them so much the stereotypical latino family i need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have a talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone i just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends i must say its so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once war movie is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in a while however a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such a film  then again calling cold mountain a war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with a quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldiers tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived  cold mountain soon takes a drastic turn though as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins a long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm adas cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast coming to adas rescue is the course toughasnails ruby thewes played by renée zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada  within these two settings a vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn south unfolds the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as rubys deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century its hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant  director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot  make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of a feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether taut and organically gripping edward dmytryks crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller an unlikely message movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle  bivouacked in washington dc a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars three of them end up at a strangers apartment where robert ryan drunk and belligerent beats their host sam levene to death because he happens to be jewish police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum whos assigned to ryans outfit suspicion falls on the second of the three george cooper who has vanished ryan slays the third buddy steve brodie to insure his silence before young closes in  abetted by a superior script by john paxton dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs ryan naturally does his prototypical angry white male and to the hilt while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance his role however is not central young may never have been better gloria grahame gives her first fullyfledged rendition of the smartmouthed vulnerable tramp and as a sad sack whos leeched into her life paul kelly haunts us in a small peripheral role that he makes memorable  the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing but its pretty much confined to youngs reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier thus incidentally stretching chronology to the limit at least theres no attempt to render an explanation however glib of why ryan hates jews and hillbillies and  curiously crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it  the novel its based on richard brooks the brick foxhole dealt with a gaybashing murder but homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale news of the holocaust had however begun to emerge from the ashes of europe so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against antisemitism the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer  but while the change from homophobia to antisemitism works in general the specifics dont fit so smoothly the victims chatting up a lonesome drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd even though or especially since theres a girlfriend in tow it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tipoff to the original engine generating ryans murderous rage ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india  the film tells the reallife scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment  amongst various police officers  colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar a young hotblooded cop coming from a poor family his father is a harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his fathers ideologies  incidences of his fathers atrocities on his mother anands approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anands constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniorsthis leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired jobsatisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms  bars also turning him to an alcoholic  the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police  politicians are a inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended  the direction is a master piece  thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shettys house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hairraising moments  the practical approach of script is a major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly  finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly my first exposure to the templarios  not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cant hide the fact that the film is deadly dull theres a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars  set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous  ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo a physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living a nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that 10000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cant bluff for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this  bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love  is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles   this initially unsympathetic character a scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 a man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo  the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would  is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out   never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia not unlike the machinist and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend a man whom he hasnt seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to a man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is a fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita è bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer ie damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they dont half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a meercat all this and i havent even mentioned the killer im not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as im concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasnt because of their acting talent ive certainly seen a lot worse but ive also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry i bought this film at blockbuster for 300 because it sounded interesting a bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong  having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i dont usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what shes wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent thisas if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worse  it is but not in that way  in a way this worries methe only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides its teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story ive been writing into a pg13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think its number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it  just say no to this movie though 210 the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught thats it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just dont watch the movie ive warned you ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this didnt even really have one to begin with  where to begin the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the housegreat double glazing the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt  pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction  add a lead actress who cant act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope  given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80s mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraphed at least ten minutes before  after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon  it really is only a movie as they say okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle  but whats wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david koepp  a great writer  is heaven  due to the lack of love for this show by many i cant see it going to a season series  but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me  lets hope something good can make it past a first series after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie it was that listless and formulaic but the us propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat its the work of humans call me a conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and theres also a bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up shes clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap a dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says dont you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like shes a child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that its so astonishingly bad you do get a few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others   this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies   if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldnt recommend this movie this movie is based on the book a many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites a topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time  other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined  the cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie wwaste  take for example about two dozen fbi  local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the sixshooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that gods army was okay and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders  mormon missionaries  and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughable  dutchers only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what dutcher shows having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity  the conclusion which im assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home  and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making a movie that someone can identify with this movie struck home for me being 29 i remember the 80s and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own ive noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and a keen sense of greed and laziness you cant get anywhere  i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs its made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere id love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas as a disclaimer ive seen the movie 56 times in the last 15 years and i only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasnt in the musical however it tainted me when i watched the musical     i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey i think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just doesnt save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan dont go out of your way to see this film how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary steenburgen i would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz  orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case  there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston  the henry luce clone thatchers memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kanes story this method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incident  this is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about a legendary business leader  here it is tom garner spencer tracy a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators  they are garners right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public  she sees only the flaws in henry  typical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes toms confrontation with the union in a major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the unions headquarters  killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black  im not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kanes success few films do  including all of orson welles other films but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home  when they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at a cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her  similarly tom too gets a full shock which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with a son  but it turns out to be eves son by toms son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself  the film is not a total success  the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from a wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is a first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means its still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance  the genres wellknown weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair  fulcis ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look  3 out of 10 limping killers return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kungfu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the westerns clint eastwood digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days  this film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era  act one sets up the premise workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they cant do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times  act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods  kinda like mr miyagis style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox way  act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used adnausem in hollywood flicks they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday so if youre game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis franchot tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their country  jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being belted in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france with jimmys unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him  recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy gladys george rose was really in love with jimmys good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her its when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully recovered from his wounds was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmys proposal of marriage to her  with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred whos still in love with her a bitter and resentful young man it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and nonviolent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york citys underworld not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster  jimmys life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival mobsters while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together   spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law its at freds circus where he works as both manger and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job that he himself didnt have the heart to do for him bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940s and the corpse vanishes is

doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards  you have got almost everything in this movie the scientists assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf her sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in belas house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie  the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun  rating 3 stars out of 5 i cannot believe i enjoyed this as much as i did the anthology stories were better than par but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself where i have i seen them before forget the running time listed on new lines tape this aint no 103 minutes according to my vcr timer and imdb space maggot douses the campfire in his own special way and hikes this an 8 the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 911 sociopolitical landscape maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the awhupping they deserve its really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him cant be denied the right to ever vote again theyve clearly shown they have no sense of character  what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology cant help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism execution and murder selfdefense and patriotism his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation hes helped create sound like any belligerent overprivileged retarded yale cheerleaders you know of   wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen as sympathetic as robespierres plight is its comforting to know that shortly after the film ends hell have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine as someone has already mentioned on this board its very difficult to make a fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance a plausible premise a narrative flow and really believable acting aka great acting   such is not the case with love machine it starts to show its faux hand about the 20minute mark with 60 minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in its downhill from there  director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do a real doc couldnt get funding and settled for a cheaper way of making his film  the premise  people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website  was perhaps more interesting in 199798 when the film was made eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff  a pushy host handheld cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites  all i guess to elicit a sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course its not going to be an oscar nominated film its just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes  the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert its just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes a lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience  id give the hills have eyes ii 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that only although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bored and nothing else  410 i laughed all the way through this rotten movie its so unbelievable a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage has a breakdown in front of a real estate office what happens the office manager comes outside and offers her a job hilarious next thing you know the two women are going at it yep theyre lesbians nothing rings true in this lifetime for women with nothing better to do movie clunky dialogue like i dont want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didnt take it doesnt help theres a wealthy distant mother who disapproves of her daughters new relationship a sassy black maid  unbelievable that in the year 2003 a film gets made in which theres a sassy black maid hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave the woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids sheesh no cliche is left unturned no spoilers  after hitchcocks successful first american film rebecca based upon daphne dumariers lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period  mistaken identity and espionage as the us settled into world war ii and the large scale war effort of civilians building planes weaponry and other necessary militia the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good law abiding citizens knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption wartime sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc who coauthored the script were a perfect match for hitchcocks sensibilities  this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old barry kane robert cummings who while at work at a los angeles airplane factory meets new employee frank frye norman lloydd and moments later is framed for committing sabotage fleeing the authorities who dont believe his farfetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful freaks and a popular billboard model patricia martin priscilla lane who during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security he falls madly in love with of course in the land of hitchcock patricia kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix  in good form for this outing hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies average joes and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving its a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited culminates in one of hitchcocks more memorable finales look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the wartime shooting ban on public attractions while saboteur may not be one of hitchcocks most well known films its a popular bmovie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual  terrific hitchcock villains remember to look for hitchcocks cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film hitchcocks original cameo idea that was shot him fighting in sign language with his deaf wife was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago  its not a big movie and doesnt try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie  the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway  this is a characterdriven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple  yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the longsuffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been  although it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay  i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot ive just watched fingersmith and im stunned to see the 810 average rating for the show  not only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly applied  the actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tedious  and just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film  the end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the evening  two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy none for the rest of it so lets begin  the movie itself is as original as cronenbergs movies would usually appear  my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses she is as lovely as usual this cutie  i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow   the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array   recommend with confidence besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i dont think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did an unmarried woman named stella bette midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own things go ok until the child named jenny trini alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worse  ive seen both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affected me much and i cry easily but they were wellmade if dated trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of beaches to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by todays standards even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen collins and marsha mason both good actors dont help in supporting roles flimsy and dull reallywho thought this would work see the 1937 stanwyck version instead i give this a 1 dont torture a duckling is one of fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films  and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for  this is still a very unique and enjoyable film  the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations  either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both  include the towns police force a smalltime reporter a beautiful and rich exdrug addict a young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé a mentally handicapped townsman and a deafmute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed  dont torture a duckling is neither a classical giallo or a typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both  it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulcis later works this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter films  but dont despair dont torture still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one a look 8510 busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad badass bitch alexandra the faithful acolyte of faust an evil entity trapped in hell determined to free her master the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive trolllike creatures called lite and dark  now alexandra must find a replacement gem which isnt going to be easy the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her exlover police detective jonathan graves peter liapis who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of meanwhile wisecracking interdimensional halfpints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home  in the warped movie world of jim wynorski all females are bigbreasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker ghoulies iv is no exception every woman in this filmwhether she be a police captain a curator of antiquities or a mental patient in an asylumis hot hot hot and wears not a lot and its this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable  but be warned even though the presence of seminaked quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful the black humour as the dvd blurb describes it is about as funny as a knee to the knackers with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringeworthy and the special effects are bargain basement consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier  310 solely for the high bimbo quotient i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie it didnt have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali larter her acting had a lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie thank you im not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not even though marques houston did appear in hp3 he played a totally different character he was eight years older in this film okayso reid and martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry a film all by themselvesbut to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies im sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing a sequelnot a totally different film with a familiar name and im sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversioni have to give this a thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write a space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space  putting on a brave show in the face of disaster  has been done time and time again  max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw 50 million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster 50 thousand to learn that the film was nominated for a special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gobsmacked  i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects  and the plot holes are too numerous to mention but i will pick one out as an example now im no nasa expert but surely its highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pearshaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who has not been in the control room before  the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script  i give this film 2 out of 10 with the aboveaverage work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i dont go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a fing baseball bat make a bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a do we have an understanding offsetting his small role however is dan acroyd who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it honestly  this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i havent made up my mind if this helps or hinders it if the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter  but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd its not that shocking its not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it  rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos   the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that  absolutely nothing going for this overhyped mess on the other hand  genesis  cerdas sequel to aftermath now available as a double feature released by unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material although i dont care for aftermath at all genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment theres tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of youespecially if you didnt watch sepet andor gubra for 76 times  i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future   and i absolutely love the voiceovers its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsins voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the tree  it captured malaysians attitudeand in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tonguedcomplete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isnt sorted out   all i can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it   it kept me glued to the screen i couldnt even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha i am not a golf fan by any means on may 26 about 1030 pm the movie started with a scene in the late 1800s old movies i like but not golf however within the first scene a young boy harry vardon is awaken by the voices of men he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something so  then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on the movie is excellent we then see this young boy now a man professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning dont want to give away too much  i was up until 2 am this is super please see the movie upon viewing tobe hoopers gem crocodile in 2000 i developed a great interest in the collegecrocodile niche of the exploitationmonster genre i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts with ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all wed need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants  while tobe hoopers crocky opus referenced his own movies blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusionshomagesripoffs to jaws temple of doom indiana jones last crusade the convent godzilla 2000 and any james bond movie also try to find the readyfortv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock  i was disappointed the crock didnt get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalismor crocky appreciation but the quasicaptain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach perhaps in the coming years well see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zerog monkeymidgetcrocodile bloodshed  allinall the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with a cast like shô kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davies it really is the perfect badventure of all time its actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have a modern feel it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it i think its an okay adventure movie and i really love the soundtrack damn i want the theme song the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they dont because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman  that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired its not something hes proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt  lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when hes on   coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities cant touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal then  coburns gang includes morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston has chris mitchum along who is his soninlaw to be  the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and im thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there is a lot   for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men is your film maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a buffoon but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator turns out its way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever theres a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little tack and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creaturekillerwhatever entrails of a virgin has neither its safe to say its a pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very worst ever made its there just for horndog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads  in this case were given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by a murderer as hes credited first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like its from another movie then once settled into the house theres a wrestling scene thats poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like damatos creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men andor rapes the women one by one  now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad an eyegouging scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name i cant remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors youd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one where its just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the i hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes when sharif or please god palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass what does that leave us with one comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castros manic and unremitting cigarfellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie this film took me by surprise i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a 78 rotten tomatoes users ranked it at 79 and the critics averaged an amazing 82 if anything they underrated this little gem  filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike  minas son doug was going to take us as a matter of fact i doubt that doug h\n"
